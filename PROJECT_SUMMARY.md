## Environment Variables
All environment variables are optional and the application gracefully degrades:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - For metadata (defaults to localhost)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Contact form (logs to console if not set)
- `CONTACT_TO` / `CONTACT_FROM` - Email addresses
- `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Newsletter (shows disabled message if not set)

## Deployment Ready
The project is ready to deploy to Vercel:
1. All builds pass
2. Environment variables documented
3. Graceful degradation for external services
4. README with full deployment instructions
5. .gitignore properly configured

## Key Design Decisions
1. **No Gradients**: Pure solid colors for a calm aesthetic
2. **Soft Blue Accent**: Using oklch color space for perceptually uniform colors
3. **Minimal Motion**: Gentle fade/slide animations respecting prefers-reduced-motion
4. **Graceful Degradation**: All external services (Resend, Supabase) work without configuration
5. **Accessibility First**: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, high contrast colors

## File Count Summary
- 8 Section components (Hero, About, Projects, Timeline, Media, Gallery, Contact, Newsletter)
- 11 Shared components (Header, Footer, Container, etc.)
- 12 UI components (shadcn/ui)
- 1 API route (Contact)

## Next Steps for Production

2. Replace placeholder CV with actual CV
3. Configure Resend API key for contact form
4. Configure Supabase for newsletter subscriptions
5. Update content in section components as needed
6. Set NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL to production domain
